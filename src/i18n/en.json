  "INTRO_TITLE" : "Project description",
  "INTRO_DESCRIPTION_1":"The video game market is one of the largest in the world, and <strong>Steam</strong> is the largest PC video game distribution platform. On this platform, users can buy, download and play video games, as well as interact with other users through the Steam community.",
  "INTRO_DESCRIPTION_2":"In this community, users can share content, such as screenshots, videos, guides, etc. In addition, users can rate the video games they have played, and can write reviews about them.",
  "INTRO_DESCRIPTION_3":"For this reason, it is important to know what are the most important aspects for users when buying a video game, and for this reason a sentiment analysis of the reviews of Steam video games has been carried out.",


  "BENTO_TITLE_1": "General Objective",
  "BENTO_CONTENT_1": "Evaluate the degree of influence that user ratings have on the acceptance of a video game within the community of players in the Steam Store.",
  "BENTO_TITLE_2": "Specific Objectives",
  "BENTO_SUBTITLE_2": "",
  "BENTO_CONTENT_2": "Search for an open data repository hosted on the Kaggle platform that contains detailed information about video games, including their positive and negative ratings, average playtime and average playtime.",
  "BENTO_TITLE_3": "",
  "BENTO_SUBTITLE_3": "",
  "BENTO_CONTENT_3": "Determine the variables that have the greatest influence on the acceptance of a video game through a detailed analysis of the correlation coefficients.",
  "BENTO_TITLE_4": "",
  "BENTO_CONTENT_4": "Analyze the relationship between the positive and negative ratings of video games, using statistical analysis techniques to determine the relative impact of each type of rating on the general acceptance of games on the platform.",
  
  
  "SINGLE_TEXT_ITEM_TITLE_1": "Hypothesis",
  "SINGLE_TEXT_ITEM_CONTENT_1": "The ratings of a video game do not significantly influence the acceptance of a video game by the community of players in the Steam Store.",
  
  "SINGLE_TEXT_ITEM_TITLE_2": "Target Population",
  "SINGLE_TEXT_ITEM_CONTENT_2": "At the epicenter of our research are the video games available in the Steam Store. This platform, recognized for its diversity, hosts a wide range of titles that go beyond simple entertainment. We focus our attention specifically on these video games, analyzing key data to understand the factors that influence their acceptance by the gaming community.",


  "INTRO_CONTENT_TITLE_1": "Key Results",
  "INTRO_CONTENT_CONTENT_1": "Through a thorough analysis, our research has revealed fascinating patterns and trends in the Steam Store. Among the key results are:",
  
  
  "BENTO_2_TITLE_1": "Influence of Positive Ratings",
  "BENTO_2_CONTENT_1": "Positive ratings emerge as a crucial factor for the general acceptance of a game. The positive correlation between positive ratings and acceptance suggests that laudatory comments significantly impact the popularity of a title.",
  "BENTO_2_TITLE_2": "Negative Ratings and their Relative Impact",
  "BENTO_2_CONTENT_2": "Although negative ratings also influence, their impact is less compared to the positive ones. The community tends to value positive experiences more, which is reflected in the probability of game acceptance.",
  "BENTO_2_TITLE_3": "Average Playtime",
  "BENTO_2_CONTENT_3": "Contrary to expectation, the average playtime does not show a significant correlation with positive acceptance. It indicates that the duration that users dedicate to a game is not a determining factor for its acceptance.",


  "INTRO_CONTENT_2_TITLE_1": "Conclusions",
  "INTRO_CONTENT_2_CONTENT_1": "The overwhelming influence of positive ratings highlights their central role in the acceptance of a game. This finding underscores the importance of building experiences that generate positive comments, a key factor for success on the platform.",
  "INTRO_CONTENT_2_CONTENT_2": "Although negative ratings have an impact, their influence is more moderate compared to the positive ones. The community tends to weigh positive experiences more, suggesting that negative aspects can be overcome by the overall quality of the game.",
  "INTRO_CONTENT_2_CONTENT_3": "Contrary to expectations, the average playtime does not emerge as a decisive factor in acceptance. This indicates that the duration of play is not the only measure of success; quality and emotional resonance play fundamental roles.",
